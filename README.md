Welcome aboard all cat lovers.

Research suggests that looking at cat images, especially cute ones, can reduce stress and improve mood. Studies have shown that viewing cat videos and pictures can lead to increased positive emotions and a decrease in negative feelings. This effect is so significant that some researchers even suggest that it could be used as a form of digital pet therapy or stress relief.

Being a cat lover myself, I thought why not create an app out of it.

This app also had its learning curves, as I was revisiting Jetpack Compose after a long time. Making api calls with Retrofit, implementing local storage with RoomDB, and using hilt for dependency injection, I have tried to use best practices as much as possible.

## ‚ú® Features

A modern Android app built using **Jetpack Compose**, **Room Database**, and **Hilt** that allows users to explore, search, and favorite cat breeds and images.

- üîç **Explore Tab**  
  View a grid of cat breeds and search by name with live results.

- üì• **Favorites**  
  Save and view favorite cat images locally using Room Database.

- üåê **Network Integration**  
  Fetch cat images and breed data using Retrofit.

- üîÑ **Pull-to-Refresh**  
  Easily refresh data with swipe down gesture.

- üíæ **Offline Storage**  
  Favorites are stored locally using Room and persist across launches.

- üíÖ **Material You Theming**  
  Dynamic color support with Google Fonts integration.
## üî® Structure

data/
- network/
- db/
- dao/
domain/
- repository/
- model/
presentation/
- viewmodel/
- ui/
- components/
di/
- NetworkModule.kt


- **ViewModel** manages UI state using `StateFlow`.
- **Repositories** abstract DB and network logic.
- **DAOs** handle local data persistence.
- **Retrofit** interfaces fetch data from API.


## üóº Architecture

Data --> Domain --> Presentation

Unidirectional reverse flow of data.

Cat Interface --> Cat Repo --> Cat ViewModel --> CatView

For Favourites

RoomDB --> CatDao --> SavedImageRepo --> ViewModel --> UI View
## ‚úÖ Roadmap

 - Add pagination

 - Dark mode toggle

 - Share image functionality

 - Unit tests


## üõ†Ô∏è Run Locally

- Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/prithviraj2002/CatApp
```

- Get the branch
   ```bash
   cd cat-app

- Open in Android Studio

- Run on emulator or device

- Make sure you‚Äôre connected to the internet to load API data.

#### üîë API
Uses TheCatAPI.
To use your own key, add it to your baseUrl in Endpoints if required.
